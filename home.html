       <h2 class="text-center">Coming this Summer! <strong>BIBCAT 2.0</strong></h2>
       <hr>
       <p>Last year, in conjuction with the U.S. Library of Congress, we developed 
       	   the first library catalog based on the BIBFRAME linked data vocabulary. 
       	   This was a <strong>proop-of-concept</strong> designed to test a range of 
       	   open source technologies. Mainly focusing on a robust low cost server core.
       </p>
       <p>BIBCAT 2.0 will be a beta version focusing on a middleware solution to optimize
       	data-deduplication and indexing. As well as an improved front-end design.</p>
