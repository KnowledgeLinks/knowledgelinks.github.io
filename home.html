       <p>At KnowledgeLinks we are developing the next gerneration of library solutions. 
       	Using low cost open source technologies to make a <strong>linked data</strong> platform bringing
       	your library to your patron's phone, tablet and home computer.
       	</p>
       <h2 class="text-center">Why <strong>Linked Data</strong>?</h2>
       <hr>
       <p>Linked Data is the premier method to efficiently connect your library to the internet. The old
       	MARC records provide no logical relationship to information outside your
       	catalog requiring slow arduous cataloger input. Linked Data allows you to enhance the catalog and patron interface experience to a simple digital platform the patron is familiar and comfortable with. Linked data allows you to pull the information you want from 
       	acrosss the web logically, neatly, and efficiently into your catalog.</p>
       <h2 class="text-center">Cataloger of the Future!</h2>
       <hr>	
       <p>Our platform will allow catalogers to escape the world of data entry. Instead they
       	will be solely concerned with searching and organizing their desired information providing an enhanced end product with minimal time and effort.</p>
       <h2 class="text-center">Coming this Summer! <strong>BIBCAT 2.0</strong></h2>
       <hr>
       <p>Last year, in conjuction with the U.S. Library of Congress, we developed 
       	   the first library catalog based on the BIBFRAME linked data vocabulary. 
       	   This was a <strong>proof-of-concept</strong> designed to test a range of 
       	   open source technologies focusing on a robust low cost server core.
       </p>
       <p>BIBCAT 2.0 will be a beta version focusing on a middleware solution to optimize
       	data-deduplication and indexing as well as an improved front-end design.</p>
