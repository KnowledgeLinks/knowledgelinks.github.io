       <p>At KnowledgeLinks we are developing the next gerneration of library solutions. 
       	Using low cost open source technologies to make a <strong>linked data</strong> platform to bring
       	your library to your patron's phone, tablet and home computer.
       	</p>
       <h2 class="text-center">Why <strong>Linked Data</strong>?</h2>
       <hr>
       <p>Linked Data is how to connect your library to the internet. The old
       	MARC records provide no real relationship to an information outside of your
       	catalog. Linked Data allows your to enhance your catalog and patron 
       	experience to something that they are more familiar. There is too much
       	information alreay available via linked data that a single group of catalogers
       	can't keep up. Linke data allows you to pull information that you want from 
       	acrosss the web into the catalog.</p>
       <h2 class="text-center">Cataloger of the Future!</h2>
       <hr>	
       <p>Our platform will allow catalogers to escape the world of data entry. Instead they
       	will be more concerned in searching and organizing information so that their patron's
       	can quickly find what they need.</p>
       <h2 class="text-center">Coming this Summer! <strong>BIBCAT 2.0</strong></h2>
       <hr>
       <p>Last year, in conjuction with the U.S. Library of Congress, we developed 
       	   the first library catalog based on the BIBFRAME linked data vocabulary. 
       	   This was a <strong>proop-of-concept</strong> designed to test a range of 
       	   open source technologies. Mainly focusing on a robust low cost server core.
       </p>
       <p>BIBCAT 2.0 will be a beta version focusing on a middleware solution to optimize
       	data-deduplication and indexing. As well as an improved front-end design.</p>
