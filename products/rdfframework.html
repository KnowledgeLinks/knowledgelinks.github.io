		<hr>
		<p>The versitility of RDF allows a simple means for describing anything. 
			Using our developed vocabulary for describing a web application 
			we are building a framework for a highly customizable, secure and a 
			fully RDF/bigdata integrated web application.</p>
		<p>Since RDF databases do not have inherent forced data structures like SQL Databases 
			(i.e. table defs, primary keys, etc) they have great flexibility. However, with 
			the increased flexibility comes other challenges:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Challenge of consistant object saving</li>
			<li>Redudant data</li>
			<li>Data consistancy</li>
			<li>Consistancy between modules reading and saving data</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To solve this problem the kds vocabulary completely integrates with any 
			RDF vocabulary (i.e. schema, FOAF, etc.) by augmenting those vocabularies 
			with how they are to be used in the specific application.</p>
